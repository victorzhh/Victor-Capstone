<!-- HEADERS -->
    <h1> This is a Heading 1</h1>
    <p>this is a paragraph</p>

    <h2>This is a Heading 2</h2><h4>Headings are blocks that display on their own line</h4>
<!-- Experiment what - what is the smallest heading number? What happens if you try <h100> which is clearly not a real thing? -->
    <!--The heading number that makes the smallest text is 6-->
    <h6>Hello</h6>

    <!--<h100> makes the text the same as if there were no tags at all-->
    <h100>Whats up</h100>

<!-- Check out how this part looks in the browser or preview -->
<p>This is a bunch of untagged text</p>

<p>Because            it is untagged there won't be any separation</p>








<p>Even if I put a space above this.</p>


<p>You see what I mean?</p>
<p>This is all a continuous paragraph.</p>


<!-- P TAGS! -->
    <p>With paragraph tags I can create separation</p>
    <p> Next paragraph please!</p>
<!-- Go back and add some <p> and </p> tags to break up the preceeding text -->
<!-- Experiment! What happens if you use just an opening tag, or just a closing tag? -->
    <!--If you only use an opening or a closing tag, it is as if no tags were used at all-->
    <!--It also apparently creates an error in the website and does not get display but it's not like that in the preview-->
    <p>hello 
    how is it going


<!-- IN-LINE TAGS-->
    <p>New semantics: <strong>strong</strong> <em>emphasized</em></p>
<!-- Can you figure out how to make something bold AND italicized? -->
        <!--Use <em> </em> and <strong> </strong>-->
        <em><strong><p>Sup</p></strong></em>

<!-- LOREM -->
<!-- Use lorem+Tab or lorem+Enter to quickly get filler text! Try it out-->

<!-- OTHER TAGS -->
